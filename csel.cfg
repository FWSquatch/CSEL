#Cyberpatriot Scoring Engine: Linux v 0.3
#Tested in Ubuntu 16.04. Somewhat compatible with 14.04 (working
#on making this work fully).
#
#Set up your scoring by changing the values in this file. Turning
#off silentMiss is helpful for debugging. Many of these you can 
#leave blank if you are not scoring them. Once you have this file
#set up, then open a terminal and navigate to the CSEL directory.
#Change the permissions of the install file: chmod 777 install.sh
#and run sudo ./install.sh. This will create the csel file, the 
#index file, and a cron job to update scoring every 2 minutes. 
#After this, you can delete the CSEL directory.
